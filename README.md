Puerto Rico Map using raphael.js
=========================

I was looking to a map of Puerto Rico in .svg format to do some code using Raphael.js library, and did not found a good map of Puerto Rico, divided in cities that I can actually use to do some stuff with javascript. Besides some web pages that want to charge almost $60 dollars for it. So I just did one using illustrator and save it in .svg for anyone to use it.

## What you will found here?
- A map of Puerto Rico divided in tiles in .svg format.
- A .js files that have the same map converted to RaphaelJS.
- And some code that will let you hover over the cities and know which city you are hover on.
